Title: Classification of archaeobotanical data using linear discriminant analysis to understand crop husbandry
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Elizabeth Stroud
Maintainer: Elizabeth Stroud <elizabeth.stroud@arch.ox.ac.uk>
Description: This package contains functions which conduct linear discriminant analysis using one of three modern models (i.e., sets of discriminated modern arable fields) to classify archaeobotanical samples on the basis of relevant functional ecological traits (or attributes) of weed species. Other functions include a data organisation function, as well as functions for plotting the results of the LDA.
